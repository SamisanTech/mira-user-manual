Slice mode slices packed mesh files with customisable options such as resolution, base type, base thickness, layer thickness, anti-aliasing factor and blur radius.

Currently, the MIRA3D can generate slices only in PNG file format.

----

**1. Resolution**

To set the resolution of the slices according to the printer resolution.

**2. Base Type**

To select the appropriate base type (outer boundary/bounding box).

**3. Base Thickness**

To add thickness to the base.

**4. Layer Thickness**

To specify the layer thickness in which the build-platform is to be sliced.

**5. Perforation**

To add perforation to the base.

**6. VSD Factor**

Propreitary MIRA algorithm for improved part surface smoothness.

*Finally, use the Slice option to slice all the packed mesh files.*
